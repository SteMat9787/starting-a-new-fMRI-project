# Starting-a-new-fMRI-project
Info about the first steps to do when starting a new fMRI project: 
- get feedback on your design;
- ethical submission;
- Acquire data at GIfMI (Ghent Institute for Functional and Metabolic Imaging, http://gifmi.ugent.be/).

---
## presentation of your fMRI design to get useful feedback from the fMRI community (optional but recommended)

#### Once your experimental design is almost ready, it would be good to present it to our fMRI community to get feedbacks and suggestions about it. 
 
```diff
@@ You find in the current repository the template for such presentation (both in .pptx and in .key formats)@@
```

The format of these presentations should be:
- a short introduction of your experimental hypothesis and questions you want to address
- a more detailed description of your experimental design
- an overview of your expected results and how these will support or not your hypothesis

for a total length of 15/20 minutes.

Having feedback and suggestions from other fMRI experts at this early stage of your experiment will help you improve your design before the MRI acquisition starts and decrease the possibility of regretting your choices once you will be analysing your data or writing your papers! 
 
Contact the fMRI support postdoc Stefania Mattioni (stefania.mattioni@ugent.be), to book a slot for your presentation.

## Ethical submission
#### When you start a new project or experiment you need to get an ethical approval.

This can be done through the Hiruz website:
- Go to the website of hiruz [https://hiruz.be/] and click the research portal, which is the new platform for ethical approval [https://hiruz.be/research-portal/].
- The info on how to register to the portal and get access are here: [https://uzgent.be/over-uz-gent/organisatie/commissie-voor-medische-ethiek/onderzoeksportaal/hoe-krijg-ik-toegang-tot-het-onderzoeksportaal] (only in dutch!!)

## Aquire data at GIfMI
#### There are several steps in order to acquire MRI data 
   - MRI Safety Course (contact the GIfMI research assistant Stephanie Bogaert - Stephanie.Bogaert@UZGent.be)
   - Create  a user account on the GIfMI website (find info here: http://gifmi.ugent.be/drupal/system/files/documents/GIfMI_user_account_EN.pdf)
   - Get the GSB Number for your project (used for all comunication and booking);
   - Submit the GIfMI Study Proposal Form to the Site Menager Pieter Vandemaele (piloting a study is allowed at this stage). Find the form here: http://gifmi.ugent.be/drupal/system/files/documents/GIfMI_study_proposal_form_EN.pdf
   - Book your slot for Technical test and protocol tuning (contact the GIfMI site menager Pieter Vandemaele - Pieter.Vandemaele@UGent.be);
   - Book your sccanning time according to the GIfMI booking Policy [http://gifmi.ugent.be/drupal/system/files/documents/GIfMI_booking_policy_EN.pdf]
