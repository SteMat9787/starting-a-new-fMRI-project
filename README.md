# Starting-a-new-fMRI-project
Info about the first steps to do when starting a new fMRI project: 
- Get feedback on your design;
- Ethical submission;
- Acquire data at GIfMI (Ghent Institute for Functional and Metabolic Imaging).

---
## Presentation of your fMRI design to get useful feedback from the fMRI community (optional but recommended)

#### Once your experimental design is almost ready, it would be good to present it to our fMRI community to get feedbacks and suggestions about it. 
 

**You can find in the current repository the template for such presentation (both in [.pptx](https://github.com/fMRI-ugent/starting-a-new-fMRI-project/blob/main/Template_fMRInewDesign.pptx) and in [.key](https://github.com/fMRI-ugent/starting-a-new-fMRI-project/blob/main/Template_fMRInewDesign.key) formats)**


The format of these presentations should be:
- a short introduction of your experimental hypothesis and questions you want to address
- a more detailed description of your experimental design
- an overview of your expected results and how these will support or not your hypothesis

for a total length of 15/20 minutes.

Having feedback and suggestions from other fMRI experts at this early stage of your experiment will help you improve your design before the MRI acquisition starts and decrease the possibility of regretting your choices once you will be analysing your data or writing your papers! 
 
Contact the fMRI support postdoc Stefania Mattioni (stefania.mattioni@ugent.be), to book a slot for your presentation.

## Ethical submission
#### When you start a new project or experiment you need to get an ethical approval.

This can be done through the Hiruz website:
- Go to the [website of hiruz](https://hiruz.be/) and click the research portal, which is the new [platform for ethical approval](https://hiruz.be/research-portal/).
- The info on how to register to the portal and get access are [here](https://uzgent.be/over-uz-gent/organisatie/commissie-voor-medische-ethiek/onderzoeksportaal/hoe-krijg-ik-toegang-tot-het-onderzoeksportaal) but only in dutch!!

## Aquire data at GIfMI: several steps
#### All the manuals and documents listed below (and further info) can be find on the [GIfMI website](https://mrighent.ugent.be/site/).
##### IMPORTANT: you need ethical approval to start the data acquisition procedure at GIfMI!

###  *MRI Safety Course*

This is a mandatory course to learn which are the risks in the magnetic resonance environment and how to avoid them.
This training consists of 2 parts (both mandatory): 
1. 60min e-learning course to be followed online
2. on site illustration

**YOU ALREADY FOLLOWED THE SAFETY COURSE IN THE PAST. SHOULD YOU TAKE IT AGAIN FOR YOUR NEW MRI STUDY? Here the general rules:**
1. Anybody who wants to work in the facility has to follow the safety training initially;
2. If you have participated in a training at GIfMI for a previous study and you have subsequently worked in the facility (i.e. you participated in the scanning procedure of an experiment), you don't need to follow the on site training again. If it has been more than a year, it is strongly recommend to follow the e-learning again. Ask Stefania Mattioni (stefania.mattioni@ugent.be for the e-learning course).
3. If you followed the training in the past (e.g. one year ago) but the project never started, you never gained experience with working in the facility --> you need to follow the training (both e-learning and on site) again.

**Contact the GIfMI research assistant Stephanie Bogaert - Stephanie.Bogaert@UZGent.be to know when is the next available safety course.**


### *Submit the GIfMI Study Proposal Form to the Site Menager*
The GIfMI site manager is Pieter Vandemaele (Pieter.Vandemaele@UGent.be).
You can find the [Study Proposal Form here](https://mrighent.ugent.be/site/assets/doc/GIfMI_study_proposal_form_EN.pdf).
After the acceptance of your study proposal you will get a GSB number for your project (used for all comunication and booking). 

### *Book your slot for Technical test and protocol tuning* 
Contact the GIfMI site menager Pieter Vandemaele - Pieter.Vandemaele@UGent.be to book your 2h slot;
During this time (free of charge) Pieter Vandemaele will set your scanning protocol and will help you with all the technical test (trigger, button box, etc..)  

### *Book your scanning time* 
Here you can find the [GIfMI booking policy](https://mrighent.ugent.be/site/assets/doc/GIfMI_booking_policy_EN.pdf).
The last section (Rates per reserved hours) of this document is not up to date. The scanning price is going to increase soon: more detailed info will come soon!
How to book the scanning time? [Here you find detailed explanations](https://mrighent.ugent.be/site/assets/doc/GIfMI_booking_manual_EN.pdf).

### *Scan price at GIfMI* 
#### Due to ongoing changes a final decision on the scanning price from 2023 onwards is not yet known.

Here the last news from GIfMI (January 10th, 2023):

*The Financial Department of Ghent University (DFIN) has imposed on GIfMI management that the inflation index has to be applied on scan prices. The inflation index for this year is set at 10.63%. All scan hours from 1/1/2023 onward will be billed accordingly, i.e. 2022 scan price * 1.1063.*
 
*UPDATE ON CORE FACILITIES*
 
*GIfMI will transition into a UGent CORE facility, as this is required to keep the facility sustainable and improve on our services. This means that scan prices will be raised to cover the actual costs over the next years. The exact details are not yet known, as preparations for CORE facility application are underway. We will likely introduce a grace period for projects that have started before 1/1/2023.*
 
*To give you some idea, the actual cost (scanner, maintenance etc) of one scan hour (scanner only) is €294.29 + a fee for use of peripheral equipment (€7.27 per hour) . If you apply for new funding this year, please make sure you request enough budget to cover these costs + future indexation. We hope to inform you as soon as possible with more details. Please be patient, we are not able to answer questions until the final decisions on the pricing policy have been made.*
