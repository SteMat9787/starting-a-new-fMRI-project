# Starting-a-new-fMRI-project
Info about the first steps to do when starting a new fMRI project: 
- Get feedback on your design;
- Ethical submission;
- Acquire data at GIfMI (Ghent Institute for Functional and Metabolic Imaging).

---
## Presentation of your fMRI design to get useful feedback from the fMRI community (optional but recommended)

#### Once your experimental design is almost ready, it would be good to present it to our fMRI community to get feedbacks and suggestions about it. 
 
<p align="center">
**You can find in the current repository the template for such presentation (both in .pptx and in .key formats)
https://github.com/fMRI-ugent/starting-a-new-fMRI-project/blob/main/Template_fMRInewDesign.key**
</p>

The format of these presentations should be:
- a short introduction of your experimental hypothesis and questions you want to address
- a more detailed description of your experimental design
- an overview of your expected results and how these will support or not your hypothesis

for a total length of 15/20 minutes.

Having feedback and suggestions from other fMRI experts at this early stage of your experiment will help you improve your design before the MRI acquisition starts and decrease the possibility of regretting your choices once you will be analysing your data or writing your papers! 
 
Contact the fMRI support postdoc Stefania Mattioni (stefania.mattioni@ugent.be), to book a slot for your presentation.

## Ethical submission
#### When you start a new project or experiment you need to get an ethical approval.

This can be done through the Hiruz website:
- Go to the website of hiruz [https://hiruz.be/] and click the research portal, which is the new platform for ethical approval [https://hiruz.be/research-portal/].
- The info on how to register to the portal and get access are here: [https://uzgent.be/over-uz-gent/organisatie/commissie-voor-medische-ethiek/onderzoeksportaal/hoe-krijg-ik-toegang-tot-het-onderzoeksportaal] (only in dutch!!)

## Aquire data at GIfMI: several steps
#### All the manuals and documents listed below (and further info) can be find on the GIfMI website (http://gifmi.ugent.be/)

###  *MRI Safety Course*
Contact the GIfMI research assistant Stephanie Bogaert - Stephanie.Bogaert@UZGent.be
This is a mandatory course to learn which are the risks in the magnetic resonance environment and how to avoid them.
Here is a guidance paper on MR safe practices: http://gifmi.ugent.be/drupal/system/files/documents/Greenberg_et_al_JMRI_2019.pdf

### *Create  a user account on the GIfMI website* 
You can find info on how to create your GIfMI account here: http://gifmi.ugent.be/drupal/system/files/documents/GIfMI_user_account_EN.pdf

### *Submit the GIfMI Study Proposal Form to the Site Menager*
The GIfMI site manager is Pieter Vandemaele (Pieter.Vandemaele@UGent.be).
You can find the Study Proposal Form here: http://gifmi.ugent.be/drupal/system/files/documents/GIfMI_study_proposal_form_EN.pdf
After the acceptance of your study proposal you will get a GSB number for your project (used for all comunication and booking). 

### *Book your slot for Technical test and protocol tuning* 
Contact the GIfMI site menager Pieter Vandemaele - Pieter.Vandemaele@UGent.be to book your 2h slot;
During this time (free of charge) Pieter Vandemaele will set your scanning protocol and will help you with all the technical test (trigger, button box, etc..)  

### *Book your scanning time* 
Here you can find the GIfMI booking Policy [http://gifmi.ugent.be/drupal/system/files/documents/GIfMI_booking_policy_EN.pdf]
The last section (Rates per reserved hours) of this document is not up to date. The scanning price is going to increase soon: more detailed info will come soon!
How to book the scanning time? Here you find detailed explanations: http://gifmi.ugent.be/drupal/system/files/documents/GIfMI_booking_manual_EN.pdf
